      🎙️ Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) Streamlit App
This project implements a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system using a Streamlit web application. It allows users to upload audio files to detect underlying emotions.

✨ Features
 1.🔊 Audio Upload & Analysis: Upload WAV files for emotion detection.

2.🧠 Emotion Classification: Detects various emotions.

3.📊 Visual Feedback: Displays the detected emotion with a color-coded indicator and visualizes the audio waveform.

4.🗣️ Text-to-Speech Response: Provides an audio response summarizing the detected emotion.

5.⚙️ Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
🐍 Python 3.8+

📦 pip (Python package installer)

📚 Required Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)

1. Clone the Repository ⬇️
First, clone this GitHub repository to your local machine:

       git clone https://github.com/Gowtham-s-3/speech-emotion-streamlit.git
   
       cd speech-emotion-streamlit

3. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended) 🌳
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies:

python -m venv venv
 # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies 📥
Install all the necessary Python libraries using pip:

       pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Streamlit Application ▶️
Once all dependencies are installed, run the Streamlit app:

       streamlit run app.py

This will open the application in your default web browser.

🚀 Usage
⬆️ Upload Audio: Use the "📁 Upload Audio for Analysis" section to upload a .wav file.

🔍 Analyze: Click the "Analyze Uploaded Audio" button to see the emotion prediction and the audio waveform.

📂 Project Structure

1.app.py: The main Streamlit web application.

2.predict_emotion.py: Contains the predict_emotion function, which loads your trained model and predicts emotion from audio.

 3.model/: Directory containing your trained emotion model (svm_emotion_model.pkl) and label encoder (label_encoder.pkl).

 4.utils/features.py: Contains utility functions for audio feature extraction.

 5.requirements.txt: Lists all Python dependencies.
